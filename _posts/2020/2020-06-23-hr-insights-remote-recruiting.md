At ePages we do remote recruiting all over the year, because we’re not only hiring employees from Germany but also from all over the world - we have recruited employees e.g. from Greece, Russia, Canada, and many more countries.
Now, due to COVID-19 we had to conduct all job interviews remote.
We will explain you in this blog post how our remote recruiting looks like and what have changed due to COVID-19.

## Remote recruiting process

Our remote recruiting process is not very different from our usual application process. 
ePages is a digital company - so, we have already implemented many digital processes before.
For the remote recruiting process during COVID-19 we only had to adapt details to the new situation.

Here are the steps of the usual remote recruiting process:

1. Of course, first we review the application, and if the applicant meets the requirements, they receive an invitation for an interview.
2. Then we have a telephone interview with the applicant. If the applicant is abroad, we use Skype or BigBlueButton for the telephone call - both tools are free of charge and very easy to use which makes it easier for applicants to get along. Afterwards our tech applicants receive a coding challenge they have to work on within a week.
3. The next step is an interview via video call with one HR Manager, and one of our Head Managers, or one of the team members.
4. Followed by a second interview (incl. get-together with the team) or a trial day which we organize fully remote via video call.
5. In the end we make our decision about the applicant and let them know about the decision.

## Remote trial day 

We created a remote version of the trial day for each of our RnD teams.
The procedures in the trial days differ from team to team.
- There are usually many people involved and the day is also remotely easy to handle, so we don't take any risks here.
- As a tech candidate you get access to the internal chat tools and video conferences of the relevant team and participate remotely in the daily routines.

To sum it up our trial days follow this structure:

1. Welcome session: You get to know the team.
2. - Task session: You will get a little task during the day or in preparation you have to work on.
3. Social session: You're having a break, where you can have lunch and exchange with the team.
4. Presentation session: You will present the results of your tasks to the team.
5. Check out session: You get feedback and say good bye.

## Personal meetings during COVID-19

When COVID-19 started, we didn’t do any personal meetings and switched to fully remote-recruiting quite quickly.
But currently, it is possible for us to invite applicants for a personal meeting again.
As we already mentioned, the first interview normally takes place on the phone.
There, we take the opportunity to talk about the specific requirements of the current situation.
Together with the applicant, we discuss what needs to be considered and whether, for example, a personal meeting is an option for the candidate.
Important factors, whether a personal interview can take place, are for example: How many people are involved in total - do we have a room where sufficient distance can be kept? Is the majority of the team members in the office or in the home office? Does the applicant feel comfortable coming for a personal interview?

If the applicant is coming to a personal interview, we need to follow the restrictions related to COVID-19.
When welcoming the applicant, we refrain from shaking hands at the moment - even if this sometimes feels strange.
Furthermore, we have disinfectants available everywhere, we air the rooms before and after, possibly also during the meetings, and make sure that there is enough distance between the participants.
If necessary, we also provide a mouth and nose protector for the interview.

## Challenges in remote recruiting

One big challenge in remote recruiting is definitely that you cannot perceive the candidate directly.
Usually, we do a little office tour after interviews which is not possible with remote recruiting.
- But as we are a company in a digital world, we are very familiar with remote situations and focus more the advantage behind like checking remote skills.
And to let the candidate participate in our social life too, we always integrate social chat sessions in between - especially during trial days.

## Tips for applicants

There are some points applicants should consider in the remote recruiting process:

- Prepare yourself 15-30 minutes earlier than the appointment starts.
- Be available via telephone or e-mail all the time before and during the interview.
- Check if your internet connection, webcam, and headset/microphone works correctly.
- - Use Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as a browser.
- Try to find a place, where the light is good so that the webcam can catch a good picture of you, and also pay attention to what can be seen in your background - for example dirty dishes.
- Don't worry, technical problems can occur, but we always find a solution.

And last but not least: Be open-minded, relax, and keep calm.
