A toggle switch works like a physical switch, that can be used e.g. to turn the light on and off.
In the cockpit we display toggle switches to enable merchants to turn a feature on or off, and to enhance cards with additional features.

The UI element "checkbox" is used quite similarly.
Check the section "Choosing between toggle switch and checkbox" below and have a look at the inventory entry [Checkboxes](/beyond-essence/inventory/checkboxes/) to find the right element for your use case.

## Use cases

In the cockpit, toggle switches have two main use cases:

### Activate significant features

Some toggle switches in the cockpit have a significant impact on the functionality of the cockpit and the merchant's workflow.
When their default state is changed, typically more than one part of the cockpit is impacted.

**Example: Website settings**

* **Website is live**: When the merchant activates this toggle, the website goes live and will be visible to customers.
Customers will be able to view and interact with the merchant's website. This is an important step for the merchant, as they need to make sure they're all set before activating the toggle.
* **Allow visitors to make purchases on your website**: When the merchant activates this toggle, a cart will be displayed at the top of the website and each product will have an "Add to cart" button, allowing visitors to order the merchant's products.
The merchant needs to make sure they are ready to sell (and not only showcase) their products on their website before activating the toggle.

üí° _Note: This is a temporary solution and might be handled differently in the future._

### Enhance cards with extensions

The cockpit is customizable.
In order to allow merchants to adapt the cockpit to their needs, they can turn features on or off.
This is possible, for example, on single cards.

**Example: Enable pricing for variations**

For the pricing of variation products, the merchant has two options:

* If the toggle is _disabled_ (default): The same price will be applied to all variations 
* If the toggle is _enabled_: A table opens on the same card and allows the merchant to set an individual price for each variation.

Both options don't have an impact on the functionality of the other cards, but enhance or reduce the functionality of the Pricing card only.

## Structure

A toggle switch looks like a classical on/off switch.
The two different states give a clear visual feedback, so that the merchant is always aware if the toggle switch is turned on or off.

* A checkmark on a green background, toggled to the right, represents an active feature.
* A cross on a beige background, toggled to the left, represents a deactivated feature.

On the right side of the toggle switch, a label clearly explains the action that can be taken.

Depending on the complexity of the feature, additional content is shown below the toggle switch.

For further information on the exact visualisation of addtional content, consult the design section.

## Position

Toggle switches may be positioned on a card together with further UI elements that relate to a specific topic.

## Behavior

By selecting either the switch itself or its lable, it changes its state:

## Choosing between toggle switch and checkbox

Toggle switches and checkboxes seem to be quite similar as they are both used to activate some sort of "settings".

To decide when to use a toggle switch, here are some clues:

* Use a toggle switch to allow merchants to enable features that have a significant effect on their workflow.
* Use a toggle switch to enhance a card with additional content.
* Don't use a toggle switch to activate small and distinct options, like an additional price field.
* Don't use a toggle switch, when the merchant needs to select multiple items in a list that need to be saved afterwards.

## Copy writing

As toggle switches typically allow merchants to enable or disable features that have a significant effect on their workflow and data might be lost when they deactivate a previously activated feature, make sure the label and description are precise and make it easy for the merchant to understand the consequences of activating/deactivating the toggle.

* Be short, precise and direct
* Start the toggle label with a verb, e.g. ‚ÄúAllow visitors to make purchases on your website.‚Äù (exception: ‚ÄúWebsite is live‚Äù)
* If there is a static description text underneath the toggle, describe what will happen when the switch is on.
Start with ‚ÄúIf this toggle is activated‚Ä¶‚Äù
* If the description text only appears after the feature is toggled on, describe what will happen when the switch is turned off.
Start with: ‚ÄúIf you toggle off FEATURE‚Ä¶‚Äù
* Don't use neutral or ambiguous phrases.
* Avoid asking questions.

**DO**: "If this toggle is activated, there will be a cart displayed in the header of your website as well as an "Add to cart" button on each product.
Be sure to save any changes."

_Precisely explains what happens when the switch is turned on._

**DON'T**: "Display a cart in the header of your website."

_Too ambigous, unclear if this is what happens when the toggle is turned on or off_

## Design

An activated toggle switch comes with a white checkmark icon on a green background, whereas a deactivated toggle switch is visualised via a white "close icon" on a beige background.
Immediately after toggling the switch from off to on more information and/or functionality is displayed in an area with light beige background below the toggle switch.
